      "Dynamic languages such as JavaScript are more difficult to compile \
than statically typed ones. Since no concrete type information \
is available, traditional compilers need to emit generic code that can \
handle all possible type combinations at runtime.We present an alternative \
compilation technique for dynamically-typed languages \
that identifies frequently executed loop traces at run-time and then \
generates machine code on the fly that is specialized for the actual \
dynamic types occurring on each path through the loop. Our \
method provides cheap inter-procedural type specialization, and an \
elegant and efficient way of incrementally compiling lazily discovered \
alternative paths through nested loops. We have implemented \
a dynamic compiler for JavaScript based on our technique and we \
have measured speedups of 10x and more for certain benchmark programs.";

    const article =
      "such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, are popular \
since they are expressive, accessible to non-experts, and make \
deployment as easy as distributing a source file. They are used for \
small scripts as well as for complex applications. JavaScript, for \
example, is the de facto standard for client-side web programming \
and is used for the application logic of browser-based productivity \
applications such as Google Mail, Google Docs and Zimbra Collaboration \
Suite. In this domain, in order to provide a fluid user \
experience and enable a new generation of applications, virtual machines \
must provide a low startup time and high performance.\n\
    Compilers for statically typed languages rely on type information \
to generate efficient machine code. In a dynamically typed programming \
language such as JavaScript, the types of expressions \
may vary at runtime. This means that the compiler can no longer \
easily transform operations into machine instructions that operate \
on one specific type. Without exact type information, the compiler \
must emit slower generalized machine code that can deal with all \
potential type combinations. While compile-time static type inference \
might be able to gather type information to generate optimized \
machine code, traditional static analysis is very expensive \
and hence not well suited for the highly interactive environment of \
a web browser.\n\
    We present a trace-based compilation technique for dynamic \
languages that reconciles speed of compilation with excellent performance \
of the generated machine code. Our system uses a mixedmode \
execution approach: the system starts running JavaScript in a \
fast-starting bytecode interpreter. As the program runs, the system \
identifies hot (frequently executed) bytecode sequences, records \
them, and compiles them to fast native code. We call such a sequence \
of instructions a trace.\n\
    Unlike method-based dynamic compilers, our dynamic compiler \
operates at the granularity of individual loops. This design \
choice is based on the expectation that programs spend most of \
their time in hot loops. Even in dynamically typed languages, we \
expect hot loops to be mostly type-stable, meaning that the types of \
values are invariant. (12) For example, we would expect loop counters \
that start as integers to remain integers for all iterations. When \
both of these expectations hold, a trace-based compiler can cover \
the program execution with a small number of type-specialized, efficiently \
compiled traces.\n\
    Each compiled trace covers one path through the program with \
one mapping of values to types. When the VM executes a compiled \
trace, it cannot guarantee that the same path will be followed \
or that the same types will occur in subsequent loop iterations. \
